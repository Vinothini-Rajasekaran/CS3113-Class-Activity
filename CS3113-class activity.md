CLASS ACTIVITY - CS 3113 SPRING 2019

This activity is to create a C program to store information using structures with dynamic memory allocation.

Perform the tasks below:

- [x] Program must take an integer input from the user into a variable named `no_of_student_records`.
- [ ] Allocate the memory of no_of_student_records structure variable using malloc() function.
- [x] Create a structure named course with the following variables in it: student_id, marks and subject.
- [ ] Based on the no_of_student_records value entered by the user, for each record get the information `student_id`, `mark` and `subject` from the user.
- [x] Finally print out all the details for all student records.
- [ ] Make sure you can pass the test case by running `test.bats`.

Note, in this assignment you will use the `scanf` function to get data from the user.
For most cases, we will use command line arguments.

The skeleton for the code is available in structure.c.

After you are done do the tasks below:

git add structure.c

git commit -m "My finished code your name here"

git push origin master

git tag v1.0

git push origin master
